# Introduction

This documentation includes guides on how to configure systems 
and pieces of software. 

## Requirements

As of right now, the only supported operating systems are 
the ones listed below. 

- [Linux](./linux.md)
- [macOS](./darwin.md)

In theory, any Unix-like operating system could qualify. In practice,
other Unix-like operating systems have mostly become irrelevant.

## Vision

The goal is to unify the experience between various Unix-like
operating systems. We will typically try to respect the native
and recommended way of doing things on the respective platform.
